## The Problem

-   Most data scientists are self-taught programmers

-   Often know they have gaps in their knowledge

    -   And other gaps they don't even know about

---

## Complexity

-   One of those gaps is software design

-   A large program is more than just a dozen small programs

-   Most programming language features exist to manage complexity

## How to Learn Design

-   Best way to learn design is to analyze, critique, and recapitulate examples

-   These lessons use small versions of programming tools as examples

    -   Generally accessible to people who are programming

    -   Introduce some fundamental ideas in computer science

    -   People who know how tools work are (hopefully) more likely to use them well

---

## Who's Your Audience?

<figure>

</figure>


-   Experts understand lower and higher abstraction levels than novices

-   Preferred level shifts with experience

-   Code that is optimal for one reader may not be optimal for another

---

## Audience

-   Maya has a master's degree in genomics

-   Knows enough Python to analyze data from her experiments

-   But is struggling to write code that other people (including her future self) can use

-   These lessons will teach her how to design, build, and test large programs
    in less time and with less pain

---

## Prerequisites

-   Write Python programs using lists, loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and functions

-   Puzzle your way through Python programs that use classes and exceptions

-   Run basic Unix shell commands like `ls` and `mkdir`

-   Read and write a little bit of HTML

-   Use Git to save and share files

---

class: aside

## In Addition

-   Yim teaches two college courses on web programming

-   They are frustrated that so many books talk about details but not about design
    and use examples that their students can't relate to

-   This material will give them material they can use in class
    and starting points for course projects

---

## The Big Ideas

-   Source code is just text.

-   A program in memory is just a data structure.

-   We can control and inspect programs while they are running.

-   A week of hard work can sometimes save us an hour of thought.
