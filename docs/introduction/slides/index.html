## Background

> We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.
> <br>
> — Marshall McLuhan

-   The best way to learn design is to study examples
-   [Brown2011, Brown2102] dissected real open source applications
    -   Too big and too scattered
-   [Brown2016] used small working models instead
    -   Too many languages
    -   Most application domains unfamiliar to most readers
-   [Wilson2022] tried to fix both problems
    -   One language: JavaScript
    -   Familiar problems: the tools programmers use every day

---

## This Material

-   Python 3
-   (Mostly) command-line applications
-   All less than 200 lines long

<table>
<tr><td>testing framework</td><td>interpreter</td><td>versioned file backups</td></tr>
<tr><td>file cache</td><td>dataframe</td><td>object persistence</td></tr>
<tr><td>binary storage</td><td>build manager</td><td>static site generator</td></tr>
<tr><td>page layout engine</td><td>editor</td><td>web server</td></tr>
<tr><td>package manager</td><td>regexp matcher</td><td>parsing text</td></tr>
<tr><td>style checker</td><td>virtual machine</td><td>debugger</td></tr>
</table>

## Who You Are

-   **Aïsha** started writing Python in an undergrad geology course.
    After spending grad school creating ever-more-complex Jupyter notebooks
    she wants to learn how to build packages other people can use.
-   **Rupinder** is a computer science undergrad.
    He has learned a lot of theory,
    and uses Git and unit testing tools in assignments,
    but doesn't understand how they work.
-   **Yim** teaches courses on full-stack web development and software design.
    They are happy with the former,
    but frustrated that books about the latter are so abstract
    and use examples that their students can't relate to.

---

## What You Will Get Out of This

-   This material will fill in some gaps in **Aïsha's** programming knowledge
    and teach her some common design patterns.
-   This material will give **Rupinder** a better understanding of his tools
    and show him how to design new ones.
-   This material will give **Yim** starting points for a wide variety of course assignments.

---

## You Should Already Know…

-   How to use dictionaries, exceptions, and classes.
    -   We assume that if you can use these,
        you can also use lists, loops, conditionals, and functions.
-   Create static web pages using HTML and CSS.
-   Use Git to save and share files.
    -   It's OK not to know the more obscure commands.
-   Process nested lists recursively.
    -   This is the most complicated thing we *don't* explain.

## Pedagogical Notes

1.  Diagrams help (most) people learn [Wilson2019]
    -   But take time to create and are a pain to maintain
    -   So these slides are mostly text for now
1.  We will be live coding during lessons
    -   I will use a simple text editor and a Unix shell
        to avoid screen clutter
    -   Please follow along in the IDE of your choice
1.  You can download the source code for all the examples from [the book's website][sdxpy_site]
    and use it as a starting point for exercises

---

## Conditions

-   All participants must abide by our Code of Conduct
    -   Respect and politeness are mandatory
    -   Being helpful and welcoming are strongly encouraged
-   All code is shared under the [Creative Commons - Attribution - NonCommercial License][cc_by_nc]
    -   You can re-use and remix, but must cite the source
-   All written material is shared under the [Hippocratic License][hippocratic_license]
    -   You can re-use as long as you don't violate human rights treaties
-   Contributions are very welcome and will be acknowledged
    -   Plese submit issues and pull request to [our GitHub repository][sdxpy_repo]
    -   Or [email Greg Wilson][email]

---

## Format and Expectations

-   Meet on Zoom each week for an hour
    -   Each session will run at 09:00, 12:00, and 15:00 Eastern time starting Wednesday, February 15
    -   You only need to attend one session each day
-   Discuss on Slack between meetings
    -   Please ask lots of questions
    -   And answer other people's
-   Expect to spend 2-3 hours/week doing exercises
    -   I understand that real life will occasionally get in the way…
    -   …but I reserve the right to uninvite you if you fall too far behind

---

## Acknowledgments

-   Christian Drumm, Julia Evans, Joe Nash, Juanan Pereira, and Dave Smith for feedback
-   Randi Cohen for being a great editor
-   Mike, Jon, and the other Jon for many conversations
