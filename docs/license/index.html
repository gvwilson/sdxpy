<p>Licensor hereby grants permission by this license ("License"), free of charge,

associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without
restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify,
merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and
to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the
following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The above copyright notice and this License or a subsequent version published
    on the <a href="https://firstdonoharm.dev/">Hippocratic License Website</a> shall be
    included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. Licensee has
    the option of following the terms and conditions either of the above
    numbered version of this License or of any subsequent version published on
    the Hippocratic License Website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compliance with Human Rights Laws and Human Rights Principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Human Rights Laws. The Software shall not be used by any person or
    entity for any systems, activities, or other uses that violate any
    applicable laws, regulations, or rules that protect human, civil, labor,
    privacy, political, environmental, security, economic, due process, or
    similar rights (the "Human Rights Laws"). Where the Human Rights Laws of
    more than one jurisdiction are applicable to the use of the Software,
    the Human Rights Laws that are most protective of the individuals or
    groups harmed shall apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human Rights Principles. Licensee is advised to consult the articles of
    the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">United Nations Universal Declaration of Human
    Rights</a> and
    the <a href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles">United Nations Global
    Compact</a>
    that define recognized principles of international human rights (the
    "Human Rights Principles"). It is Licensor's express intent that all use
    of the Software be consistent with Human Rights Principles. If Licensor
    receives notification or otherwise learns of an alleged violation of any
    Human Rights Principles relating to Licensee's use of the Software,
    Licensor may in its discretion and without obligation (i) (a) notify
    Licensee of such allegation and (b) allow Licensee 90 days from
    notification under (i)(a) to investigate and respond to Licensor
    regarding the allegation and (ii) (a) after the earlier of 90 days from
    notification under (i)(a), or Licensee's response under (i)(b), notify
    Licensee of License termination and (b) allow Licensee an additional 90
    days from notification under (ii)(a) to cease use of the Software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indemnity. Licensee shall hold harmless and indemnify Licensor against
    all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions,
    judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or
    expenses of whatever kind, including Licensor's reasonable attorneys'
    fees, arising out of or relating to Licensee's non-compliance with this
    License or use of the Software in violation of Human Rights Laws or
    Human Rights Principles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforceability: If any portion or provision of this License is determined to
     be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
     then such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any
     other term or provision of this License or invalidate or render
     unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon a
     determination that any term or provision is invalid, illegal, or
     unenforceable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the court may
     modify this License to affect the original intent of the parties as closely
     as possible. The section headings are for convenience only and are not
