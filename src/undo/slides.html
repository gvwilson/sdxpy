## The Problem

-   Want to change files as well as viewing them

-   So modify the file viewer of [%x viewer %] to allow editing

-   And since people make mistakes when editing, implement undo

---

## Starting Point

-   `Window` can draw lines and report its size

-   `Buffer` stores lines of text,
    keeps track of a viewport,
    and transforms buffer coordinates to screen coordinates

-   `Cursor` knows its position in the buffer
    and can move up, down, left, and right

-   `App` makes a window, a buffer, and a cursor,
    then maps keys to actions

## A Headless Screen

-   Create a [%g headless "headless" %] screen for testing

-   Store current state of display in rectangular grid

-   Take a list of keystrokes (for simulation)

    -   Would have made more sense for `App` to have a method
        that gets keystrokes

---

## A Headless Screen

[% inc file="headless.py" keep="screen" %]

---

## Bad But Necessary

-   Also need to define `HeadlessWindow` to take a size
    and pass it to the screen

[% inc file="headless.py" keep="window" %]

-   Violates the
    [%i "Liskov Substitution Principle" %]Liskov Substitution Principle[%/i%]

---

## Logging

-   Record keys, cursor position, and screen contents for testing

[% inc file="headless.py" keep="app" %]

---

## Testing

[% inc file="test_headless.py" keep="example" %]

-   Last key is always `CONTROL_X` (exit)

---

## Insertion and Deletion

[% inc file="insert_delete.py" keep="buffer" %]

-   Delete character *under* the cursor, not to the left

-   A little [%i "defensive programming" %]defensive programming[%/i%] as well

---

## Application

[% inc file="insert_delete.py" keep="app" %]

[% inc file="insert_delete.py" keep="action" %]

---

## Application

[% inc file="insert_delete.py" keep="dispatch" %]

-   Add `_get_key` to the application

    -   Return family (for generic handlers) and key (specific)

    -   Could provide per-key methods to make customization easier

---

## Testing

-   Write a function to make the fixture and run the test

[% inc file="test_insert_delete.py" keep="fixture" %]

-   Tests are straightforward

[% inc file="test_insert_delete.py" keep="example" %]

---

## Edge Case

-   Can't delete when in an empty screen

[% inc file="test_insert_delete.py" keep="empty" %]

-   Our focus is implementing undo, so leave this for an exercise

---

## Recording History

-   In order to undo things we have to:

    1.  keep track of *actions* and reverse them, or

    2.  keep track of *state* and restore it

-   Recording actions requires less space but can be trickier to implement

-   Have actions append entries to a log

---

## The Simple Approach

[% inc file="history.py" keep="app" %]

-   What about undoing cursor movement?

-   And do we write an interpreter for these log records?

---

## Verbs as Nouns

-   Use the [%g command_pattern "Command" %] design pattern

-   Each action (verb) is an object (noun)
    with methods to go forward and backward

-   Every action is derived from
    an [%i "abstract base class" %]abstract base class[%/i%]

[% inc file="action.py" keep="Action" %]

---

## Insertion and Deletion

[% inc file="action.py" keep="Insert" %]

[% inc file="action.py" keep="Delete" %]

---

## Movement

[% inc file="action.py" keep="Move" %]

-   Give `Cursor` methods to move in a particular direction (by name)
    and move to a particular location

---

## Application

[% inc file="action.py" keep="interact" %]

-   Create the action object

-   Call its `.do` method

-   Modify all action methods to take a key to simplify the code a little

---

## Application

[% inc file="action.py" keep="actions" %]

-   And it *almost* works!

-   Our first implementation of `Undo` creates an infinite loop
    because it puts itself on the undo stack
    and then does the action on the top of the stack

---

## Finally

-   Modify `Action` to have a `.save` method that returns `True`

-   Override in `Undo`

[% inc file="undoable.py" keep="Undo" %]

-   Only add object to undo stack if `.save` is `True`

-   More general design would give `Action` a `.post_action` method
    that by default adds the action to the undo stack
