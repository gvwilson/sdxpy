## Background

-   The little programming language of [%x interp %] isn't extensible

-   So add a way to define and call functions

-   And then look at design tactics this opens up

---

## Definition

-   In Python

[% inc file="example_def.py" keep="python" %]

-   In our little language

[% inc file="example_def.py" keep="def" %]

-   Keyword `"func"`
-   (Possibly empty) list of parameter names
-   Body

---

## Saving Functions

-   A function is just another object

-   Assign it to a variable so we can call it later

[% inc file="example_def.py" keep="save" %]

---

## Anonymous Functions

-   An [%g anonymous_function "anonymous function" %]
    is one that doesn't have a name

-   JavaScript and other languages use them frequently

-   Python supports limited [%g lambda_expression "lambda expressions" %]

[% inc file="example_def.py" keep="lambda" %]

---

## Implementing Call

[% inc file="example_def.py" keep="call" %]

1.  Evaluate arguments.

2.  Look up the function.

3.  Create a new environment.

4.  Call `do` to run the function's action and captures the result.

5.  Discard environment created in step 3.

6.  Return the result.

## Eager and Lazy

-   [%g eager_evaluation "Eager evaluation" %]:
    arguments are evaluated *before* call

-   [%g lazy_evaluation "Lazy evaluation" %]:
    pass expression sub-lists into the function to be evaluated on demand

    -   Gives the called function a chance to inspect or modify expressions
        before using them

-   Python and most other languages (including ours) are eager

-   R is lazy

-   A design choice

---

## The Environment

-   A variable `x` in a function shouldn't clobber
    a variable with the same name in its caller

-   Use a list of dictionaries to implement a
    [%g call_stack "call stack" %]

-   Each dictionary called a [%g stack_frame "stack frame" %]

-   Look down the stack to find the name

-   If not found, add to the current (top-most) frame

---

## Implementing Definition

[% inc file="func.py" keep="func" %]

-   Should check that parameters are strings

---

## Implementing Call

[% inc file="func.py" keep="call" %]

---

## A Test

[% inc pat="func.*" fill="tll out" %]

---

## Dynamic Scoping

-   Searching active stack for a variable is called
    [%g dynamic_scoping "dynamic scoping" %]

-   Have to trace execution to figure out what a variable might refer to

[% inc pat="dynamic.*" fill="tll out" %]

---

## Lexical Scoping

-   Almost all languages used [%g lexical_scoping "lexical scoping" %]

-   Decide what a name refers to based on the structure of the program

-   More efficient for the computer: doesn't have to search each time

-   More efficient for the person: limits scope of reasoning

-   More complicated to implement

-   But enables a very powerful programming technique

---

## Closures

[% inc pat="closure.*" fill="py out" %]

-   The inner function [%g variable_capture "captures" %]
    the variables in the enclosing function

-   A way to make data private

---
