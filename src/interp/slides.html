## Background

-   Programs are just data
-   Compilers and interpreters are just programs
    -   Compiler: generate instructions once in advance
    -   Interpreter: generate instructions on the fly
    -   Differences are increasingly blurry in practice
-   Most have a [%g parser "parser" %] and a [%g runtime "runtime" %]
-   Look at the latter in this lesson to see how programs actually run

---

## Representing Expressions

-   Represent simple arithmetic operations as lists

[% inc file="add_example.py" %]

--

-   We use special [%g infix_notation "infix notation" %] like `1+2` for historical reasons
-   Always putting the operation first makes processing easier

---

## Evaluating Expressions

[% inc file="expr.py" keep="do_add" %]

-   `args` is everything _except_ the name of the operation
-   Use an as-yet-unwritten function `do` to evaluate the operands
-   Then add their values

---

## Evaluating Expressions

[% inc file="expr.py" keep="do_add" %]

-   All the `do_` functions can be called interchangeably
-   Like the unit test functions of [%x test %]

---

## Dispatching Operations

-   Write a function that [%g dispatch "dispatches" %] to actual operations

[% inc file="expr.py" keep="do" %]

---

%]

---

## An Example

[% inc pat="expr.py" fill="tll out" %]

---

## Environments

-   Store variables in a dictionary that's passed to every `do_` function
    -   Like the dictionary returned by the `globals` function
    -   An [%g environment "environment" %]

[% inc file="vars.py" keep="do_abs" %]

---

## Getting Variables' Values

-   Choices for getting variables' values:
    1.  Assume strings are variable names
    2.  Define another function that we call explicitly

[% inc file="vars.py" keep="do_get" %]

[% inc file="vars.py" keep="do_set" %]

---

## Sequencing

-   Need a way to set values before evaluating expressions
-   `["seq", ["set", "a", 1], ["add", ["get", "a"], 2]]`
    -   LISP: Lots of Irritating Single Parentheses

[% inc file="vars.py" keep="do_seq" %]

## Everything Is An Expression

-   Python distinguishes [%g expression "expressions" %] (which produce values)
    from [%g statement "statements" %] (which don't)
-   But it doesn't have to, and many languages don't

```python
# not actually legal Python
result =
    if a > 0:
        1
    elif a == 0:
        0
    else:
        -1
```

---

## An Example

[% inc pat="doubling.*" fill="tll out" %]

---

## This Is Tedious

[% inc file="vars.py" keep="do" %]

--

-   But we know what to do

---

## Introspection

[% inc file="vars_reflect.py" keep="lookup" %]

---

## How Good Is Our Design?

-   One way to evaluate a design is to ask how [%g extensible "extensible" %] it is
-   The answer for the interpreter is "pretty easily"
-   The answer for our little language is "not at all"
-   We need a way to define and call functions of our own
-   We will tackle this in [%x func %]

## Arrays

Implement fixed-size one-dimensional arrays:

1.  `["array", 10]` creates an array of 10 elements.
2.  Other instructions that you design get and set array elements by index.

## While Loops

Implement a `while` loop instruction.
Your implemetation can use either a Python `while` loop or recursion.

---

class: exercise

## For Loops

Implement a `for` loop instruction that repeats instructions a certain number of times.
Your implementation should allow users to specify a loop variable
so that they know which iteration of the loop they're in.
