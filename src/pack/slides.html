## The Problem

-   Packages and their dependencies change over time

-   If A and B require different versions of C
    it might not be possible to use A and B together

-   Need a systematic way to find globally-consistent sets of packages

---

## Identifying Versions

-   [%g semantic_versioning "Semantic versioning" %] uses three integers `X.Y.Z`

    -   `X` is the major version (breaking changes)

    -   `Y` is the minor version (new features)

    -   `Z` is the [%g patch "patch" %] (bug fixes)

-   Notation

    -   `>=1.2.3` means "any version from 1.2.3 onward"

    -   `<4` means "any version before 4.anything"

    -   `1.0-3.1` means "any version in the specified range"

---

## A Simplified Version

[% inc file="triple.json" %]

---

## Multiple Dimensions

-   Imagine a multi-dimensional grid with one axis per package

-   Possible combinations are points in this grid

[% figure
   slug="pack-allowable"
   img="allowable.svg"
   alt="Allowable versions"
   caption="Finding allowable combinations of package versions."
%]

-   But how do we find the legal ones?

---

## Estimate Work

-   Our example has 3×3×2=18 combinations

-   Adding one more package with two versions doubles
    the [%g search_space "search space" %]

-   A [%g combinatorial_explosion "combinatorial explosion" %]

-   Brute force solutions are impractical even for small problems

-   But worth implementing as a starting point and for testing

---

## Brute Force

-   Generate all possible combinations of package versions

-   Then eliminate ones that aren't compatible with the manifest

[% inc file="exhaustive.py" keep="main" %]

---

## Generating Possibilities

-   Create a list of the available versions of each package

-   Generate their [%g cross_product "cross product" %]

[% inc file="exhaustive.py" keep="possible" %]

[% figure
   slug="pack-product"
   img="product.svg"
   alt="Generating a cross-product"
   caption="Generating all possible combinations of items."
%]

---

## Checking Validity

-   Compare every entry X against every other entry Y

-   If they are the same package, keep looking

-   If package X's requirements say nothing about package Y,
    keep searching

-   If X *does* depend on Y
    but this particular version of X doesn't list this particular version of Y
    as a dependency,
    rule out this combination

-   If combination is still a candidate, add to list

---

## Checking Validity

[% inc file="exhaustive.py" keep="compatible" %]

-   Finds 3 valid combinations among our 18 possibilities

[% inc file="exhaustive.out" %]

---

## Manual Generation

-   Create our own cross-product function
    in preparation for doing something more efficient

[% inc file="manual.py" keep="start" %]

-   Create a list of lists of available versions

-   Create an empty accumulator

-   Do some magic

---

## Manual Generation

-   Each call to `_make_possible` handles one package's worth of work

-   Loop over available versions of current package

-   Add that package to the combination in progress

-   If more packages, recurse

-   Otherwise, append to accumulator

[% inc file="manual.py" keep="make" %]

---

##

[% figure
   slug="pack-recursive"
   img="recursive.svg"
   alt="Generating a cross-product recursively"
   caption="Generating all possible combinations of items recursively."
%]

-   Use recursion instead of nested loops
    because we don't know how many loops to write

-   The [%g recursive_enumeration_pattern "Recursive Enumeration" %] design pattern

---

## Incremental Search

-   Generate-and-discard is inefficient

-   Stop immediately if a partial combination of packages is illegal

[% inc file="incremental.py" keep="main" %]

--

-   `reverse` to allow experimentation

---

## Finding Possibilities

[% inc file="incremental.py" keep="find" %]

---

## Finding Possibilities

1.  The manifest that tells us what's compatible with what.

2.  The names of the packages we've haven't considered yet.

3.  An accumulator to hold all the valid combinations we've found so far.

4.  The partially-completed combination we're going to extend next.

5.  A count of the number of combinations we've considered so far,
    which we will use as a measure of efficiency.

---

## Savings

-   We only create 11 candidates instead of 18

[% inc pat="incremental.*" fill="sh out" %]

-   Reversing the order cuts it to 9

[% inc pat="incremental_reverse.*" fill="sh out" %]

---

## Using a Theorem Prover

-   An automated theorem prover can do much better 

    -   But the algorithms quickly become very complex

-   Prove that a set of logical propositions (e.g., dependencies) are satisfiable

-   We will use the [Z3 theorem prover][z3]

    -   Whose documentation is unfortunately a barrier to entry

---

## Using Z3

[% inc file="z3_equal.py" keep="setup" %]

-   `A`, `B`, and `C` don't have values

-   Instead, each represents the set of possible Boolean values

---

## Using Z3

-   Specify constraints such as `A == B`

[% inc file="z3_equal.py" keep="solve" %]

-   Then ask Z3 to find a [%g model "model" %] that satisfies those constraints

[% inc file="z3_equal.out" %]

---

## Unsatisfiable

-   Require `A` to equal `B` and `B` to equal `C`
    but `A` and `C` to be unequal

[% inc file="z3_unequal.py" keep="solve" %]
[% inc file="z3_unequal.out" %]

---

## Packaging

-   Represent our package versions

[% inc file="z3_triple.py" keep="setup" %]

---

## Packaging

-   We want one version of `A`

[% inc file="z3_triple.py" keep="top" %]

-   But the versions of `A` are mutually exclusive

[% inc file="z3_triple.py" keep="exclusive" %]

-   Do the same for `B` and `C`

---

## Dependencies

-   Add inter-package dependencies and solve

[% inc file="z3_triple.py" keep="depends" %]
[% inc file="z3_triple.out" %]

---
