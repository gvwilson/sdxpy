title: "A Testing Framework"
template: slides
---

## Background

-   Not all software needs formal testing
    -   Check one-off data analysis script incrementally
-   But 98% of the code in [SQLite][sqlite] is there to test the other 2%
    -   For which I am grateful
-   Good tools make tests easier to write
    -   So that programmers have fewer excuses not to write them
-   This lesson build a unit testing framework like [pytest][pytest]
    -   Most frameworks in most other languages share its design

---

## The Big Idea

<p class="shout">A program is just another data structure.</p>

## Functions are Objects

-   `def` defines a variable whose value is the function's instructions

```python
def example():
    print("in example")
```

-   We can assign that value to another variable

```python
alias = example
alias()
```
```
in example
```

-   `(…)` means "run the instructions this variable refers to"

## Checking

-   Use `type` to see if something is a function

```python
type(3)
```
```
<class 'int'>
```
```python
type(example)
```
```
<class 'function'>
```

---

class: aside

## Checking

-   But built-in functions have a different type

```python
type(len)
```
```
<class 'builtin_function_or_method'>
```

-   So use `callable` to check if something can be called

```python
callable(example)
```
```
True
```
```python
callable(len)
```
```
True
```

---

## Functions in Lists

-   We can put functions in lists

```python
def first():
    print("First")

def second():
    print("Second")

def third():
    print("Third")

everything = [first, second, third]
for func in everything:
    func()
```
```
First
Second
Third
```

---

## Signatures

-   We have to know how to call the functions
    -   They must have the same __signature__


```python
def zero():
    print("zero")

def one(value):
    print("one", value)

for func in [zero, one]:
    func()
```
```
zero
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "a.py", line 8, in <module>
    func()
TypeError: one() missing 1 required positional argument: 'value'
```

---

## Terminology

-   Apply the function we want to test to a __fixture__
-   Compare the __actual result__ to the __expected result__
-   Possible outcomes are:
    -   __pass__: the target function worked
    -   __fail__: the target function didn't do what we expected
    -   __error__: something went wrong with the test itself
-   Typically use `assert` to check results
    -   If condition is `True`, does nothing
    -   Otherwise, raises an `AssertionError`
-   Failed assertions usually cause the program to halt
    -   But we can catch the exception ourselves if we want

---

## A Function and Some Tests

```python
# Should return 0 when given 0
def sign(value):
    if value < 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return 1

def test_sign_negative():
    assert sign(-3) == -1

def test_sign_positive():
    assert sign(19) == 1

def test_sign_zero():
    assert sign(0) == 0

# Misspelled 'sign'
def test_sign_error():
    assert sgn(1) == 1
```

---

## What We Want

```python
TESTS = [
    test_sign_negative,
    test_sign_positive,
    test_sign_zero,
    test_sign_error
]

run_tests(TESTS)
```
```
pass 2
fail 1
error 1
```

---

## How We Do It

```python
def run_tests(all_tests):
    results = {"pass": 0, "fail": 0, "error": 0}
    for test in all_tests:
        try:
            test()
            results["pass"] += 1
        except AssertionError:
            results["fail"] += 1
        except Exception:
            results["error"] += 1
    print(f"pass {results['pass']}")
    print(f"fail {results['fail']}")
    print(f"error {results['error']}")
```

-   Easy to create new tests
-   But we have to remember to add each function to `TESTS`
-   We'd like Python to find them for us

## How Python Stores Variables

-   Python stores variables in (something very much like) a dictionary

```python
globals()
```
```
{
    '__name__': '__main__',
    '__doc__': None,
    '__package__': None,
    '__loader__': <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>,
    '__spec__': None,
    '__annotations__': {},
    '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>
}
```

---

## Further Proof

```python
my_variable = 123
globals()
```
```
{
    '__name__': '__main__',
    '__doc__': None,
    '__package__': None,
    '__loader__': <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>,
    '__spec__': None,
    '__annotations__': {},
    '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>,
*   'my_variable': 123
}
```

--

-   *The function `locals` gives local variables*

---

## Introspection

-   We know how to loop over a dictionary's keys

```python
def find_tests():
    everything = globals()
    for name in globals():
        if name.startswith("test_"):
            print(name, everything[name])

find_tests()
```
```
test_sign_negative <function test_sign_negative at 0x10cad39d0>
test_sign_positive <function test_sign_positive at 0x10cad3e50>
test_sign_zero <function test_sign_zero at 0x10cad3ee0>
test_sign_error <function test_sign_error at 0x10cad3f70>
```

--

-   *When we print a function, Python shows its name and address*

---

## A Better Test Runner

```python
def run_tests():
    results = {"pass": 0, "fail": 0, "error": 0}
    for (name, test) in globals().items():
        if not name.startswith("test_"):
            continue
        try:
            test()
            results["pass"] += 1
        except AssertionError:
            results["fail"] += 1
        except Exception:
            results["error"] += 1
    print(f"pass {results['pass']}")
    print(f"fail {results['fail']}")
    print(f"error {results['error']}")
```

--

-   Really should check that `test` is callable
-   And we'd like a way to skip tests temporarily

---

## Objects Have Attributes

-   The function `dir` returns a list of an object's __attributes__

```python
dir("hello")
```
```
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', \
 …many more… \
 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']
```

-   __Dot notation__ is just a fancy dictionary lookup

```python
"hello".title()
```
```
Hello
```

---

## Functions Have Attributes

```python
def example():
    "Docstring for example."
    print("in example")

print(dir(example))
```
```
['__annotations__', '__call__', '__class__', '__closure__', \
 '__code__', `__defaults__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', \
 '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', \
 …many more…
]
```

-   `__name__`: the function's original name
-   `__doc__`: its __docstring__
    -   `help(x)` prints the docstring of `x`

---

class: aside

## Pragmatism

-   Some built-in types like `list` don't let you add arbitrary attributes to objects for performance reasons
-   (Almost) everything defined as a Python class does let you do this
    -   You can derive a class using `class MyList(list)` if you want to
-   This is a design choice
    -   In some languages _everything_ is an extensible object
    -   In others you must define all attributes up front
    -   And in Python, some built-in types like functions allow attributes because it's useful

---

## Classifying Test Functions

```python
def test_sign_negative():
    assert sign(-3) == -1
*test_sign_negative.skip = True

def test_sign_positive():
    assert sign(19) == 1

def test_sign_zero():
    assert sign(0) == 0
*test_sign_zero.fail = True

def test_sign_error():
    assert sgn(1) == 1
```

---

## A Better (?) Test Runner

```python
def run_tests():
    for (name, test) in globals().items():
        if not name.startswith("test_"):
            continue

        if hasattr(func, "skip")
            print(f"skip: {name}")
            continue

        try:
            test()
            print(f"pass: {name}")

        except AssertionError as e:
            if hasattr(test, "fail"):
                print(f"pass (expected failure): {name}")
            else:
                print(f"fail: {name} {str(e)}")

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"error: {name} {str(e)}")
```

---

## A Better (?) Test Runner

```python
run_tests()
```
```
skip: test_sign_negative
pass: test_sign_positive
pass (expected failure): test_sign_zero
error: test_sign_error name 'sgn' is not defined
```

-   Why the question mark?

--

1.  Adding attributes to functions is clumsy and unusual
    -   Most libraries use __decorators__
2.  This version prints results instead of returning a data structure
    -   What if we want to compare with previous results?
    -   Or convert to HTML, or…?

---

## Finding Test Files

-   Test runner should find files containing tests
    -   Typing names each time is as error-prone as typing names of test functions
-   Use the `glob` module

```python
from glob import glob

for name in glob("**/test_*.py", root_dir=".", recursive=True):
    print(name)
```

--

-   Name `glob` comes from an old Unix command that did global matching

---

class: aside

## Magic

-   We need to load test files after we find them
    -   Like doing `import` without knowing the name in advance
-   [Clarke's Third Law][clarkes_laws]:
    any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
-   Also true of technologies we encounter
    before we have the background knowledge they depend on

## Loading Dynamically

```python
from glob import glob
from importlib.machinery import SourceFileLoader

test_files = glob("**/test_*.py", root_dir=".", recursive=True)
for (i, name) in enumerate(test_files):
    m = SourceFileLoader(f"m{i}", name).load_module()
    for name in dir(m):
        if not name.startswith("test_"):
            continue
        func = getattr(m, name)
        try:
            func()
            print(f"{name} pass")
        except AssertionError:
            print(f"{name} fail")
        except Exception:
            print(f"{name} error")
```

-   *Exercises will explore why we need to call the modules `m0`, `m1`, etc.*

## Looping Over `globals`

What happens if you run:

```python
for name in globals():
    print(name)
```

What happens if you run:

```python
name = None
for name in globals():
    print(name)
```

Why?

## Counting Results

1.  Modify the test framework so that it reports which tests passed, failed, or had errors
    and also reports a summary of how many tests produced each result.

2.  Write unit tests to check that your answer to part 1 works correctly.

---

class: exercise

## Setup and Teardown

Testing frameworks often allow programmers to specify a `setup` function
that is to be run before each test
and a corresponding `teardown` function
that is to be run after each test.
(`setup` usually re-creates complicated test fixtures,
while `teardown` functions are sometimes needed to clean up after tests,
e.g., to close database connections or delete temporary files.)

Modify the testing tool in this chapter so that
if a file of tests contains a function called `setup`
then the tool calls it exactly once before running each test in the file.
Add a similar way to register a `teardown` function.

---

class: exercise

## Module Names

Our last test runner generated names `m0`, `m1`, and so on
so that each module would have a unique name.
What happens if we don't do this?
I.e.,
what happens if we use the same constant string for all modules that we load?
