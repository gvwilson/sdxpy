{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1006/bijl.1999.0426", "year": 2000, "abstract": "Some continental European populations of the land snail Cepaea nemoralis have mitochondrial haplotypes that differ by up to 20% at the 16S rRNA locus. I mapped the distribution of different lineages in populations from 36 different sites in Britain and Ireland. In 93% of individuals, one of two mitochondrial lineages was found,A or N, which differ from each other by about 6% using a 16S rRNA fragment (approximately 300 base pairs). The distribution of these two types is very striking—one is confined to Wales, West and central England, and Scotland, while the other is found mainly in East and central England. The two types meet in a transition zone. The most likely explanation for the distribution is that it reflects two routes of colonization after the last ice age. Cepaea dispersal is leptokurtic, and only limited gene flow occurs between established populations, so that the original pattern could have been retained since the post-glacial colonization. However, many environmental gradients are orientated East–West, so alternative selective explanations are possible. A distinct mitochondrial lineage, as well as fossil evidence, suggests that Ireland was colonized separately from Britain. The implications of these distributions for the origins of the puzzling geographical patterns of shell types known as «area effects» is discussed."}
