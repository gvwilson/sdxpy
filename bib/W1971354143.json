The strictly terrestrial molluscan faunas from the two atolls (Oeno and Ducie) are poor, like many other atolls in the Pacific. Each supports less than six species with wide geographical ranges. In contrast, the terrestrial molluscan fauna from Henderson Island, an uplifted atoll, is more diverse with at least 16 species belonging to seven families. Over half these taxa appear to be endemic, at least at the level of sub-species. Two species of semi-terrestrial molluscs have also been found on Henderson. Analyses of archaeological deposits in caves near the North Beach have revealed that at least a further six species of land snail formerly occurred on Henderson. The volcanic island of Pitcairn, the only island in the group still inhabited, supports the greatest number of terrestrial molluscs. Twenty-six species of land snail (and one semi-terrestrial pulmonate) were found living there during the recent expedition and a further three taxa were recognized amongst museum material. At least seven of these species are thought to be recent adventives and a further three are likely to have been prehistoric introductions. One Henderson (Georissa hendersoni) and three Pitcairn endemics (Pacificella filica,Sinployea pitcairnensisandDiastole tenuistriata) are formally described as new species. Some of the Pitcairn endemics occur in very restricted areas (less than a hectare) and it is important that measures should be taken to prevent the spread of invasive plants, such as rose-apple, that would threaten their survival."}
